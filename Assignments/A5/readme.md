# Assignment 5
## CMSC 4000 - Operating Systems
### University of Western Pennsylvania - California

To run this project:

1. Compile the `a5.c` file with the `-pthread` flag.
2. Run the `a5.py` file to generate the full LaTeX document.
3. Compile the `a5.tex` document to generate the full report.

#### Changes Needed

- Support for the different data and test cases to run automatically
  - This really only needs a change to how the item buffer is handled, instead of as a global.
